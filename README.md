# Starknet's Counter Workshop

This project implements a Counter smart contract on Starknet with an integrated Kill Switch and Ownable component from OpenZeppelin. The contract allows for incrementing a counter while checking the status of a kill switch and ensuring only the owner can perform certain actions.
